* Introduction
 This is a collecton of my various configuration files and a bash script to install it.
 BTW this script is not perfect so there may be problems durning the installation if you have a problem feel free to file an issue I will get to it as soon as I can.

* Scripts
** Arch
This one is the best tested I should work on most Arch based systems and is the only one I recomend you to use.
** Nixos
I dont know if this config is broken but I think my configuration.nix might not work on all nix systems
** Ubuntu&Debian
Idk this one still needs a lot of work but I will see if I can get this to work

* Contributing
You are welcome to contribute howevery you would like just keep in mind this is a personal project I is intended for my use case.
