* Install
Just FYI I wrote these scripts with the assumption that the dotfiles repository would be in your ~/ or Home folder.
** MacOS
I have written a script that should get all of my applications and configurations on MacOS. To Run the script just run the command below.
#+begin_src bash
./dotfiles/install/install-mac.sh
#+end_src

** Arch Linux
This script should quickly install my configuration for Arch Linux and derived distros.
#+begin_src bash
./dotfiles/install/install-arch.sh
#+end_src

** NixOS
This script has not been tested but it should work. To run the install-nix script just run the command below.
#+begin_src bash
./dotfiles/install/install-nix.sh
#+end_src

** Debian/Ubuntu
Just Run the install-deb script to install.
#+begin_src bash
./dotfiles/install/install-deb.sh
#+end_src


* Warp Themes
Warp is a blazingly fast, rust-based terminal reimagined from the ground up to work like a modern app. I have ported several themes from DOOM Emacs themes to Warp. Warp at the momment is a MacOS only terminal but plans on making it available for Linux and Windows as well. [[https://www.warp.dev/][Warp.dev]]
